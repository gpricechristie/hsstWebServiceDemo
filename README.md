# hsstWebServiceDemo
Python notebooks that use flask to show some simple examples of static and database backed dynamic websites, and demonstrate the creation  of a simple RESTful API. All examples are implemented using flask and the locally running service is exposed to the public internet using the ngrok service via pyngrok.
The repositiry contains 4 different examples:
<ln> A very basic 'Hello World' static website 
<ln> A static website using a template html file to render the page including a background image
